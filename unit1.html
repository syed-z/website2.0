    <div class="content_box content_box1">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business. <p>In the age of tech, data analysis has become part of our daily lexicon. Some say without it businesses would have a very difficult time competing. IT solutions are part of almost every process in the modern business, everything from security to customer satisfaction. Businesses have become heavily reliant on IT and we are now at a point that not having the right IT solutions could have severely detrimental outcomes. IT not only helps with the systemic running of businesses but also brings us the level of quality and efficiency we have become accustomed to. 
        Service business are also using these tools to create meaningful impact wether intentionally or not, for example money transfer companies give people the opportunities to send money to relatives living in impoverished countries or the countless organisations that help vulnerable people around the world.</p> </div>
    <div class="content_box content_box2">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? <P>Due to innovation in the sector we now have countless project management systems we could use depending on our needs. Some popular systems include agile, six sigma,  and scrum. A lot of the skills needed to complete a digital project successfully are the same as the skills we need for most things in life such as organisation, time management and good communication skills. The exception would be specific skills related to the digital technologies being used, wether it be coding, cyber security or design oriented skills to name a few. 
        Thankfully we live in an age were the market for tools needed are ever growing and contain endless amounts of resources that can assist you with any aspect of your project. what ever the task you will likely find something, from communication tools like Slack and what’s app to management tools like Trello and Lean kit.</P></div>
    <div class="content_box content_box3">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. <p>I have decided to create a simple website that showcases what I have learned in the course. I have been researching other popular sites for inspiration on design and layout. I'm currently using Trello with the kanban method to track my progress and keep my work flow organised and Slack for other helpful advice that may assist me. While building the site I'm using Visual studio code with a live stream plugin so I can see any changes I make in real time, which has made the project much easier. it also allows me to learn quicker as I can test any Ideas I have straightaway and see what worked and what didn't. There are a number of resources posted on slack by Liam our group facilitator that I use to add to the look and feel of my site.</p></div>
    <div class="content_box content_box1">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? <p>According to research carried out by computer love, a digital computer studio. An astonishing 97% of companies report to have had digital projects fail. So how in the digital age are we having so many problems with digital technologies. The answer may ironically not be linked to the technology it’s self but how we are organising. 

        Top performing companies attribute their success to a continual improvement process with a strong focus on user needs. Conversely mainstream companies have claimed that a lack of focus on the end user and leaving their testing processes to the end of projects is a big reason for the failure of their projects.
        
        The research indicates that mainstream companies have struggled with updating and innovating internal processes that contribute to poor communication between departments, short term priorities taking over, and not clearly defining the vision and strategy. </p></div>
    <div class="content_box content_box2">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? <p>Open source technologies have a distinct advantage when it comes to lifespan and improvement as they often amass a community following that takes on the project as their own. Keeping updates relevant and even making improvements to the original tech where necessary. You may even find support groups and foundations that have taken on the responsibility of the project. These communities are an invaluable resource to tap into, often times run by users who are passionate about making the tech you have chosen the best it can be.</p></div>
    <div class="content_box content_box3">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.<p>Trello has been a great tool for organising and keeping the work load clean and understandable. It helped me to map out the whole project before hand which I later came to realise would be invaluable as the code structure could become quite complex in relation to the overall layout of the site. The only thing I would have changed is that I didn’t find it easy to update troll once I had got stuck into the coding which I’m not sure if Trello could have done something different to help me remember or wether I should have made more of an effort to stop and update. I was a little worried about stopping and interrupting the flow of the coding, losing my place and constantly having to find where I was and what I was doing again. 

        Having newly been introduced to Git Hub I can see it is a fascinating resource that I have only scratched the surface of and I’m sure I will uncover many other uses as time goes on. One important aspect of Git Hub that will help me at this point in my project is the ability to update it live, ensuring I can submit my work to be assessed and carry on developing it for as long as I want. This will make it particularly easy to be able to use my projects for many different things with out needing to make many different copies and trying to keep track of them all. I am free to spend more time developing a small number of projects that can be shared for work, social or personal development rather than having many different versions of the same project that would inevitably reduce quality.</p></div>
    <div class="content_box content_box1">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? <P>With the EU’s data protection laws GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) came into affect as of the 25th of may 2018. These laws brought with them a shift in how companies can handle their customers data. GDPR applies to all businesses and organisations indiscriminately. What this means in practical terms is when considering digital projects the type of data, the way we collect data and what the legal responsibilities are to the users all need to be thought about. There is an emphasis on transparency and structure which inevitably in the long run will have a net positive outcome for your project and business. 

        Businesses will need to adopt the privacy by design framework across all uses and applications. You can find out more about “Privacy By Design Framework” by clicking the link. GDPR will bring greater control for customers over their personal data and is in response to some of the ethical and security issues we now face.
        
        Even though we have left the EU, The UK has adopted their own version of GDPR due to Brexit These changes are found in the UK government’s Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (EU Exit) Regulation (DPPEC regulation). </P></div>
        <div class="content_box21 content_box4">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.<p>Using visual studios has been very useful for being able to switch between the windows and applications easily, the interface layout is easy to use and understand. I’ve also enjoyed using Trello as I like to keep things organised and similarly Trello was easy to use and kept my work flow effortless to follow. The added benefit of Trello was that it was simple to share with Liam our group facilitator, which made it easier to review work and ask for help. 
            I used the native notes app, Slack and google chrome and found the amount of resources on the internet for help with coding is overwhelming.
            A few years ago I had switched to using an Apple Mac laptop instead of windows and had heard it was the coders choice, I can now see why. I wouldn’t say the differences are huge but more that the little things like short cuts and ergonomics of the software just seems like a smoother experience overall. </p></div>
        <div class="content_box21 content_box5">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.<p>I found the tools I for the projects on this course used were very useful and helped me to stay organised and easily work through the projects with little confusion. While it can be daunting to try and find the right IT tools to use as there is so much variety on the market I am starting to experience the benefits of finding tools that fit well with the project you are working on. 
            My experience of working in traditional office environments has been of tools and resources that were often outdated inefficient and added to the work load, often having to compensate for the shortfalls of the systems we used which inevitably lead to time and money the company could have saved with different IT infrastructures. A point I often pushed forward in meetings and conversations with my peers.</p></div>
        <div class="content_box21 content_box6">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?<p>I am happy with the overall layout of my site in relation to the nature of what I will be using it for. I needed clean, easy to navigate and easy to understand, which I feel I have achieved and the great thing about having access to Git Hub is I can update it or improve it whenever I see fit. I will however be updating the style and design of the site after submitting it for assessment as I feel that once I have a better grasp of the coding I could create something more satisfying. 

            As I’ve mentioned before the ability to update my site live will be invaluable, and another reason is my perfectionist nature which unfortunately has led to me failing to complete projects on time or take on a little more than I could manage in the past as I have never been comfortable with handing in the bare minimum of what is being asked of me. Where as in this instance I was able to constantly remind my self that I just need need to hand in the bare minimum, then I could always develop it further once its up.</p></div>
        <div class="content_box21 content_box4">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.<p>One of the things I love about coding is the endless possibilities to create any given project. I imagine it to be like having nearly every tool ever made and the ability to create new ones to suite your exact specifications at your disposal when needing to create something physical like a house for example. The drawback to this is that you can use a tool that seemingly fits your purpose but isn’t the best tool for the job (taking into account that sometimes it may just be preference as posed to which is a better tool). A greater understanding of your tool set, will result in a smoother and more articulate expression of creation. 

            I am at the very beginning of this journey learning how to use a hammer for the first time, witnessing just how much I can do with a very basic tool set fills me with excitement and trepidation about becoming proficient and what that would let me accomplish. To answer a short question long, I feel I need to become a little more accustomed to coding before I start to think about what I really want this project to be.</p></div>
            <div class="content_box21 content_box6">2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose. <p>Our last task for the project was to send all our work to our facilitator to be checked. I also skimmed through the course material and some other resources to double check I had done everything I needed. The file needed to be converted to a ZIP folder in order to be shared on slack. the ZIP folder along with the link to our Git Hub page was then sent off to the facilitator.</p></div>
            <div class="content_box31 content_box7">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? <p>Trello has made working on the coding projects much easier, particularly when working in teams. Organising and delegating were key to the success of the projects we worked on so utilising the right tools was imperative. Slack and google meets were used to communicate instantly, ensuring we all worked at the same pace. 
                If we were tasked with working in teams on the website project I believe the outcome would have been very different. There would be less of a personal touch to it and the final project would likely reflect the collaborative efforts of the team. 
                Having said working in a team would have yielded greater results as more hands on deck would create lighter a load and we could achieve more in the time we had. This would depend on how well we worked together as a team, how well the project was managed and organising the plan and strategy from the begging.</p></div>
            <div class="content_box31 content_box8">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?<p>I have had trouble sleeping at night which made concentrating in course sessions much more difficult so I in the future I would pay more attention to my daily habits making a conscious effort to take proper breaks, relax after classes as I was working overtime to compensate for the lack of focus and I would have joined the yoga glasses which I initially really wanted to join but as the time came around I was honed in on a specific task and just couldn’t pull my self away. 
                Stretching and a daily exercise routine would be extremely beneficial as I am usually active through out the day and did not consider the negative effects on my body and mind sitting down for such long periods would have. I also used a chair from my dining room which is great for half an hour but after a while you really star to realise why office chairs are more expensive, unfortunately no amount of pillow stacking helped.</p></div>
            <div class="content_box31 content_box9">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? <p>As mentioned before I would structure an exercise program that I could fit around the lessons, I would ensure I take regular breaks and take time to relax my mind maybe with some meditation. I would also structure my work a little differently now that I have the use of Trello and other tools to organise and plan my time better. I did struggle with asking for help due to the flow of the course so I would be more inclined assert myself better with the facilitators so I am not left behind and struggling to catch up. I am a firm believer in searching for obstacles within my self first as this is where I have most control, then looking outside of myself to see what support I could get that would better help me complete a project or what I could help change to better help me and others that come after me.</p></div>
            <div class="content_box31 content_box7">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions. <p>I find the best way to test anything is to use it in context in the environment which you need the use it in or as close as you can recreate working off the philosophy that failure is our greatest teacher. while testing it can be extremely help full to utilise some of the resources we have today such as the internet. there are endless sites that offer advice and support on anything we can imagine but from the little experience I have this seems to be even more so in the coding community. mentioning communities online forums and community spaces are a great place for help and support, you can find people with all levels of experience ready and waiting to assist if you just ask.
                I have found the companies who build the tools we use to have in depth articles and how to's on their sites or their own community forums. there seems to be an endless supply of knowledge and experience just waiting to be tapped into.</p></div>
