    <h1 id="amnesia_heading_1">Amnesia</h1>

    <p>This year I finally decided to take the plunge and learn coding properly. In previous years I haven’t been able to fully commit or put in the time necessary to learn. As scary and as unfortunate as the pandemic has been I have done a lot of soul searching, re evaluating where I am and where I’d like to go as I’m sure many of us have. I came across a coding course run by Code Nation which would be my first step in learning these new skills.</p>
    <p>As part of the course one of our assignments involved building a game with Python in teams of three. During this project I was fortunate enough to be paired with two great team mates who’s working style and ethic clicked well with mine, which led to a smooth, pleasant project and I would like to think a great outcome. It often felt like we were in the army, or at least with regards to the camaraderie.

    <h2 id="amnesia_heading_2">The warzone</h2>
    <p>Our team manager James Drummond, affectionately known as Corporal Jimmy Drummond was a man of principle, loyal to a fault. He had a look that made you wonder how many women had their hearts broken as he wen’t from mission to mission around the world. He was tall, handsome and always had a cigar clenched between his teeth. The man was born to lead an army, a descendant of generations of military leaders. On his 5th birthday he asked for a gun, a map and a compass so he could go off and fight in the wars. <br> 
        Corporal Jimmy always had our backs no matter what and fought right beside us in the trenches. While Anthony Taiwo, a young lad with a whole lot of smarts and the heart of a warrior, was always first choice for decoding enemy intel and infiltrating their networks. Anthony stood toweringly at 6”4 with a strong square jaw and a gait that made him look as if he was walking straight over the enemy lines to end the war with his own bare hands. While on his way back from a supply run through the mountians Anthony befriended a wolf, freeing her from a trap set by local poachers, they became inseperable. The wolf went wherever Anthony went, she even slept by his bed at night with one ear up listening out for danger, ready to protect her best friend at a moments notice. <br>
        During our mission Anthony tested and debugged the project working through every task thrown his way, while I franticly tried to find the right look and feel ensuring the story was up to scratch and engaging. The sound of fluorescent bulbs and computer fans whirring in the background, a half eaten chocolate bar and cold bitter coffee sat next to me. We worked obsesivly through the nights as the mosquitos feasted on our adreneline fueld blood. We made it through everything knowing that as long as we had each other we were never alone. Our unspoken motto became, never leave a man behind.<br>
        Rumour has it Corporal Jimmy finally found his soul mate in the Cayman Islands while recovering from a bomb blast where he saved countless lives, but the call of duty was too loud  and he left his love behind to save the world once again. If you ask me he'd spent to long in the trenches and just was'nt able go back to civilian life.
As for Anthony he left the army to open a wolf sanctuary with his new wife and 2 year old son Ant Jr. He named the sanctuary after his best friend wolfy who died in battle in Ant's arms after protecting him from an enemy ambush at the base.<br>I often wake during the night wondering if we did the right thing, if our blood sweat and tears were enough, I guess only time can tell now. I’ll always remember my time in the intel squadron, we renamed it the Code and heart breakers squad,  I’ll always remember those brave, honourable men who carried me to glory on their shoulders.
