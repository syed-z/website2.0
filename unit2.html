        <div class="boxz box01">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page.<p>I have decided to go for a simple clear layout that showcases the work I have learned in the Code nation coding course. I will have a brief summary of who I am and why I took the course, then I will add all the course work from this project to the site as clearly and as user friendly as possible.
            I have also added a page with a short fictional story loosely based on my experience in the team work session for the python game we created and there will hopefully be a playable version of the game on this page for everyone to see my teams efforts. Each page will be laid out a little differently to suit the content. I will try my best to use colours and graphics to make my site look professional while still being pleasing to the eye.</p></div>
        <div class="boxz box03">1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.<p>The laws pertaining to copyright with regard to a website are called Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and ca be found here. This law protects original creations involving literary work, music, art, film, and sound. When planing your site it is important to check the copyright laws to ensure the graphics and or music you use aren’t an infringement as you will be held legally responsible. You can find plenty of libraries that offer copyright free content, some that you pay for on a monthly subscription and some that are completely free. There’re also some media you can use such as YouTube videos which will state on the videos site whether it is sharable content or not, particularly for educational purposes.

            The same applies for copying any articles or written work. The best way to use this type of content is to reference clearly where and who this work belongs to. You can also contact the owner of the work in question if you have any doubts, some owners will ask you to pay to use their content and some may not.</p></div>
        <div class="boxz box02">1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.<p>It is important to take into consideration the end user with all your projects but more so with users who may have difficulty with access due to disabilities. It can not only be frustrating for the user but more seriously it can affect their security if mishandled which will lead to your business or project becoming vulnerable by proxy. In order to avoid these issues planing ahead will help. Education is key with regards to security so ensuring you are doing everything you can to keep the user informed about security protocols and even tailoring security measures for users with disabilities will go a long way. 

            There is also a growing market creating accessibility tools that can help you assess whether your site meets established accessibility standards which will benefit both you and the user. While these tools can be extremely useful it is important to remember that nothing can substitute a human (at least not yet anyway) so you may find it important to stay on top of how these tools are implemented and how they help/affect your users.

        <div class="boxz box03">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.<p>There is a huge list of filetypes that can be used on a website but some more popular than others. There are also some new filetypes emerging for streaming content as this saves on the space it takes to save media files. Popular image files are usually JPG, PNG or GIF and WAV, MP3, AAC and MID can be used for sound. If you need video you can try AVI, FLV or MOV files. A lot of the file types we use regularly for word documents or sending digital letters you may as DOC, DOCX, PDF and TXT and the standard file type for the base of the website is HTML. You may also use file types such as ZIP, EXE, DMG or APK if you have any executable files your user need to download.
